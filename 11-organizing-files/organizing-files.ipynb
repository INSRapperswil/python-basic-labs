    "# Organizing Files\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is about organizing files and folders and covers some parts of [chapter 10](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter10/) from the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get more information you can consult the Python documentation for [shutil](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html), [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) and [zipfile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipfile.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Libraries used\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# import the shutil module to copy, move, rename and delete folders and its contents\n",
    "import shutil\n",
    "\n",
    "# import the os module to permanently delete a single file or a single empty folder and to walk a directory tree.\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "# import the zipfile module to read, create, extract from and add to zip files\n",
    "import zipfile\n",
    "\n",
    "# import the class \"Path\" to simplify path declarations. Path.home() represents the user's home directory.\n",
    "from pathlib import Path\n",
    "home = Path.home()\n",
    "\n",
    "# import the third-party module send2trash to send files and folders to your computer's trash or recycle bin.\n",
    "import send2trash\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If a function requires a path as a parameter, it can be written as one of these options:\n",
    "- a string (`\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Username\\\\test.txt\"`)\n",
    "- a raw string (`r\"C:\\Users\\Username\\test_folder\"`)\n",
    "- a Path object (`home / \"test.txt\"`) where `home = Path.home()`. In this case, importing the \"Path\" class is necessary.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Copying, Moving and Renaming Files and Folders\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Copying Files and Folders\n",
    "\n",
    "`shutil.copy(source, destination)` will copy the file at the source path to the folder at the destination path. If the destination path is a filename, it will be used as the new name of the copied file. This function either returns a string or a Path object of the copied file.\n",
    "\n",
    "`shutil.copytree(source, destination)` will copy an entire folder and all of its contents to the destination path. This function returns a string of the path of the copied folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Moving Files\n",
    "\n",
    "`shutil.move(source, destination)` will move the file at the source path to the folder at the destination path. This function returns a string of the absolute path of the moved file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attention:** If the destination folder already contains the file at source, it will be overwritten. If the destination folder doesn't exist, the source file will be renamed to the foldername without a file extension. Use ```move()``` with care!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Moving and Renaming Files\n",
    "\n",
    "`shutil.move(source, destination)` will move the file at the source path to the destination path, renamed to the specified filename. This is also used to simply rename files in the same folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attention:** The destination path has to be accessible or else there will be an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deleting Files and Folders\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Permanently Delete Files and Folders\n",
    "\n",
    "`os.unlink(path)`/ `Path.unlink()` will permanently delete a single file specified in the path. \n",
    "\n",
    "`os.rmdir(path)` / `Path.rmdir()` will permanently delete a single empty folder specified in the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "`shutil.rmtree(path)` will permanently delete the folder and all its contents specified in the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions can be used for single files and folders or within a for-loop to mass delete files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attention:** To avoid accidental deletions, comment out the functions first and test with ```print()``` lines. Uncomment if the result is as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Safely Delete Files and Folders\n",
    "\n",
    "`send2trash.send2trash(path)` will send the file or folder specified in path to your computer's trash or recycle bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attention:** It doesn't free up disk space.\n",
    "\n",
    "send2trash needs to be installed by running `pip install send2trash` in a Terminal window.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Walking a Directory Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "If you intend to access the whole content of a folder including its subfolders and files, Python provides the `os.walk(path)`function. Use the string of the folder's path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the function in a for-loop allows it to modify each file, since it returns three values (foldername, subfolders and filenames).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with the Zipfile Module \n",
    "\n",
    "A zip file contains compressed files and folders to minimize its size and allows us to package several folders into one file, making it easier to send it over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Create a Zip File\n",
    "\n",
    "`newZip = zipfile.ZipFile('path_of_new.zip', 'w')` opens a zipfile object in write mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "`newZip.write(file, compress_type=zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED)` creates a new zipfile that contains the compressed file using the recommended compression type `'deflated'`. As per usual, use a `with` statement to automatically close the stream after utilizing `write()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter `file` in the `write()`-method must be the relative path to the file you want to add to the zip. It's recommended to use `os.chcwd(directory)` beforehand to change the current working directory to the path where the files and folders are located.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attention:** write mode will erase the contents of the specified zip file. If you want to add files to an existing zip file use `zipfile.ZipFile('path_of_existing.zip', 'a')`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Create a Zip File\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import zipfile\n",
    "from pathlib import Path\n",
    "home = Path.home()\n",
    "\n",
    "# change the current working directory to the path we're working with\n",
    "os.chcwd(home)\n",
    "\n",
    "# create a new zip file in the home directory\n",
    "with zipfile.ZipFile(\"newZip.zip\", \"w\") as zipExample:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # add the existing file 'file.ext' in the home directory to the newZip.zip file\n",
    "    zipExample.write(\"file.txt\", compress_type=zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Read a Zip File\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import zipfile\n",
    "from pathlib import Path\n",
    "home = Path.home()\n",
    "\n",
    "# create a ZipFile object using the path of an existing zip file\n",
    "with zipfile.ZipFile(home / \"new.zip\") as zipExample:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # list the strings of all files and folders contained in 'new.zip'\n",
    "    zipExample.namelist()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # this ZipInfo Object holds information about a single file in the zip file \n",
    "    #(f.e file_size or compress_size)\n",
    "    zipInfoObject = zipExample.getInfo(\"file.txt\")\n",
    "    fileSize = zipInfoObject.file_size\n",
    "    compressedSize = zipInfoObject.compress_size\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extract a Zip File\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import zipfile\n",
    "from pathlib import Path\n",
    "home = Path.home()\n",
    "    \n",
    "# create a ZipFile Object\n",
    "with zipfile.ZipFile(home / \"new.zip\") as zipExample:\n",
    "\n",
    "    # extract all the contents of the specified zip file into the home directory.\n",
    "    # to extract to an existing folder, specify the path of the folder in the brackets.\n",
    "    zipExample.extractall()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # extract a single file from the zip. This returns the string of the file's path. \n",
    "    zipExample.extract(\"test.txt\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    # extract a single file from the zip and put it in the specified folder.\n",
    "    # This returns the file's absolute path. If 'test_folder' doesn't exist, it will be created\n",
    "    zipExample.extract(\"test.txt\", home / \"test_folder\")    \n",
