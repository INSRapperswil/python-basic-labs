    "\n",
    "Please note: There are several ways how to print strings and variable values together. The book introduces so-called \"f-strings\" rather late, but we prefer to use them much sooner (as in: from the beginning and in this lesson). They are described in the summary below.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Invoking the Shell\n",
    "\n",
    "Entering the interactive interpreter is done by running `python` (or `python3`) in the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ python\n",
    "Python 3.7.3 (default, Jun 17 2019, 15:02:19) \n",
    "[GCC 7.4.0] on linux\n",
    "Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n",
    ">>> \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then enter Python code at the `>>>` prompt and get the result back:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> 23 + 42\n",
    "65\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook works similarly: Notebooks notebooks execute all lines in\n",
    "a cell if the cell is run with Ctrl + Enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables store values. You can define and reference these values by a name, e.g. `my_variable`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_variable = 10\n",
    "my_variable + 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables may be of different types. The type of the variables is determined when assigning a value: `x = 10` results in `x` being an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type           | Description                       | Example      |\n",
    "| -------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------ |\n",
    "| Integer        | Whole numbers                     | 10           |\n",
    "| Floating Point | Decimal numbers                   | 10.2         |\n",
    "| String         | Text                              | \"Hi there!\"  |\n",
    "| Boolean        | \"truthy\" values                   | True / False |\n",
    "| None           | Special value for null / no value | None         |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mathematical Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical operators take two numbers and return a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operator | Description               | Types                    | Example   |\n",

    "| /        | Division                  | Integer, Float           | 10 / 1.2  |\n",
    "| //       | Quotient / Floor Division | Integer, Float           | 10 // 1.2 |\n",
    "| %        | Remainder                 | Integer, Float           | 10 % 1.2  |\n",
    "| **       | Power                     | Integer, Float           | 10 ** 1.2 |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logical Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical operators take one or two boolean values and return a boolean value.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operator | Description | Types   | Example        |\n",
    "| -------- | ----------- | ------- | -------------- |\n",
    "| and      | Logical AND | Boolean | True and False |\n",
    "| or       | Logical OR  | Boolean | True or False  |\n",
    "| not      | Logical NOT | Boolean | not True       |\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Executing Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Executing files - interpreting line by line by the Python interpreter - is done by passing the filename to `python` (or `python3`) in the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python myscript.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Jupyter, you can start a cell with `%%writefile filename.py` (a so-called \"magic\" or \"magic command\") to write the content of the cell to a file instead of executing it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%%writefile myscript.py\n",
    "# this line gets written into the given file\n",
    "# and so does this one\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a file can then be run using the `%run` magic:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%run myscript.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments are lines or parts of lines that are not interpreted by Python. Comments are defined using the hash character (`#`) - everything after a `#` is ignored:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# let's define a variable\n",
    "my_variable = 10 # this is an integer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calling Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling functions is done by adding parentheses after the function name. Arguments are placed inside the parentheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "abs(-10)  # = 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A list of built-in functions [can be found in the Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "All variables are objects of some kind (a type or a class). More complex types such as timestamps cannot be created using a direct assignment (`x = 1`), they need to be _constructed_ first by calling the type or class. You can do this with simple types as well:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "start_date = datetime(2021, 9, 16)\n",
    "score = int(258)  # same as score = 258\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects have their own set of functions (which are called methods in this case) which can be accessed by using a period. The method name comes **after** the variable name:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "start_date.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")    # '2021-09-16'\n",
    "score.to_bytes(2, byteorder=\"little\")  # b'\\x02\\x01'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Print variables and strings\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to print strings and variable values together, of which two are used throughout this course and the book: Using a plus sign and f-strings. The plus sign concatenates strings and variables:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "hermione = \"Hermione\"\n",
    "harry = \"Harry Potter\"\n",
    "print('It is good to meet you, ' + hermione + ' and ' + harry)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will print `It is good to meet you, Hermione and Harry Potter`. \n",
    "\n",
    "To create an f-string, prepend an `f` before a string. In the string, you can put variables in curly brackets: `{variablename}`. You can even execute functions within the curly brackets - however, functions are covered in a later lab, so just take notice of this fact here.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "hermione = \"Hermione\"\n",
    "harry = \"Harry Potter\"\n",
    "print(f'It is good to meet you, {hermione} and {harry}')  # note the f at the beginning!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is the same: `It is good to meet you, Hermione and Harry Potter`. However, f-strings are much easier to read and should be preferred over the plus sign."
