    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flow Control\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow control allows you to execute parts of code based on conditions. Flow control structures consist of a keyword (`if`, `while` and `for`), an expression, a `:` and a block of indented code. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for expression:\n",
    "    block of code\n",
    "    block of code continues\n",
    "this line is not part of the \"for\" anymore\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Forgetting the colon (`:`) is a common mistake, even among experienced Python programmers. If you get a `SyntaxError` at the end of the expression line, this is most likely why.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to cover a block of code but don't want to execute some real code (or want to code that block later), use the `pass` keyword which does exactly this: nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### if\n",
    "\n",
    "Blocks inside `if` structures are executed if the condition is `True`. Checking additional conditions is possible using one or more `elif` statements. Running a block of code if no condition matches is done using the `else` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "elif condition:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "elif condition:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### while\n",
    "\n",
    "Blocks inside `while` structures are executed / repeated as long as the condition is `True`. It's possible to leave a while block using the `break` keyword or to skip to the start of the next repetition using the `continue` statement. Some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while True:  # endless looping\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    if some_other_condition:\n",
    "        break  # stop the loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    if condition:\n",
    "        continue  # jump to the next step of the loop\n",
    "\n",
    "    # code here isn't executed if the \"continue\" was run\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### for\n",
    "\n",
    "Blocks inside `for` structures are executed / repeated a specific number of times. You can use `break` and `continue` in the same way they work with `while`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for statement:\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Import system\n",
    "\n",
    "In bigger projects, you typically split up your code into multiple files. Those are called Python *modules*. \n",
    "Python comes with many such modules included. These included modules are called the Python [Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) because they are available with every Python installation, without having to be downloaded/installed separately. If you want to see what you can find in the standard library, check the [Brief Tour of the Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules must be imported using the `import` keyword before they can be used. Assuming you had a `utils.py` with a function `annoy_user` in it, you could import the entire module and use the function by specifying the imported module name before it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import utils\n",
    "\n",
    "utils.annoy_user()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "...or just import the functions, objects etc. you need, then use them directly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from utils import annoy_user\n",
    "\n",
    "annoy_user()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also possible to import everything from a module using `*` (not recommended):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from utils import *  # we don't know what we'll get\n",
    "\n",
    "annoy_user()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, we want to give the imported modules, functions etc. a new name. This is useful when importing things which would otherwise cause a naming confict:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from utils import annoy_user as notify_user\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have many different files, you'd typically split them up further, into different folders. Python calls those *packages*. Note, however, that the same term \"package\" is used for two different things: Folders containing modules, as well as for installable third-party Python projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "To become a Python package, a folder needs to contain an (usually empty) file called `__init__.py`. When importing, modules and submodules are separated using dots (`.`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming our `utils.py` module became too big, it could be split up into the following file structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `utils/__init__.py` (empty)\n",
    "- `utils/annoy.py` (contains `annoy_user`)\n",
    "- `utils/format.py` (contains `format_duration`)\n",
    "\n",
    "We could then import the module and use the full path again:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import utils.annoy\n",
    "\n",
    "utils.annoy.annoy_user()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or import modules from inside packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from utils import annoy\n",
    "\n",
    "annoy.annoy_user()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or, finally, import the function from inside the module:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from utils.annoy import annoy_user\n",
    "\n",
    "annoy_user()\n",
    "```"
