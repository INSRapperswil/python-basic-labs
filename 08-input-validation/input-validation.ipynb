    "# Input Validation\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn how to use input validation. Input validation is an important technique to prevent your application for unwanted exceptions and breakups. Like the name also mentions, input validation checks and validates each user's input before it is passed to the main logic of the application. Therefore you can guarantee that your application is only working with correct user input. Another positive side effect of input validation is that it prevents bugs and increases the security of written code. Without input validation, an attacker might be able to smuggle in malicious code into your application, which proper validation can prevent. In this lesson, you will learn how you can easily verify user input. Also, you will learn how you can do more complex tasks by using the module PyInputPlus.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It's good to remember: _Whenever your applications receives user input, validate it!_\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers parts of [chapter 8](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter8/) of the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find more information about the built-in `input()` function [in the Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the exercise you will also use the PyInputPlus module, which is written by the same author as \"Automate the Boring Stuff\". More information about this really helpful module you can find under: \n",
    "- [PyInputPlus Documentation](https://pyinputplus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Input validation code takes the input which is mostly supplied by a user and validates it. In other words, this technique checks if the input is formatted correctly. Furthermore, this method guarantees that only proper and valid input will be processed in the application. If the user (or another application) makes an improper entry, the application is not allowed to do anything with the input. In consequence, the program will not continue until the input is formatted as defined in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In several cases, an application has to check if the input is a number. A simple way to validate the input is with the built-in Python3 `input()` function: In the example above it checks whether the input consists of a number or not:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    while True:\n",
    "        number = input('Enter your number: ')\n",
    "        try:\n",
    "            int(number)\n",
    "            print('Nice! You really entered a number!')\n",
    "        except:\n",
    "            print('Unfortunately, you have not entered a number!')\n",
    "# for exiting while loop with Ctrl + C\n",
    "except KeyboardInterrupt:\n",
    "    print('\\nExiting...')\n",
    "    sys.exit()\n",
    "``` \n",
    "The code above simply checks if the input is a number and has different behaviors whether it is or not. When you run the code above, the output could look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Enter your number: 1\n",
    "Nice! You really entered a number!\n",
    "Enter your number: 11\n",
    "Nice! You really entered a number!\n",
    "Enter your number: five \n",
    "Unfortunately, you have not entered a number!\n",
    "Enter your number: Cool\n",
    "Unfortunately, you have not entered a number!\n",
    "Enter your number: ^C\n",
    "Exiting...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, it is necessary to check several inputs. If you take a look at the code above you should notice that there are several code lines for the validation of one input. With an increasing number of inputs, the code would quickly grow and would be tedious to maintain if an application has to validate every single input. With the inbuilt `input()` function it is also only possible to read the console input. The whole validation code has to be written manually. For these reasons, the module PyInputPlus was developed. This module provides several functions to read the given input and also validates it. Thus a lot of work is taken off. The most important kinds of data which the module can recognize and validate are:\n",
    "- numbers (integer and float)\n",
    "- times & dates\n",
    "- email-addresses\n",
    "- booleans\n",
    "- passwords\n",
    "- [and many more](https://pyinputplus.readthedocs.io/en/latest) \n",
    "\n",
    "The module will ensure that only validated content will be passed to the application. It also includes several other handy features like\n",
    "- mathematical functions like: `min`, `max`, `greaterThan` or `lessThan`\n",
    "- the number of tries it prompts the input message\n",
    "- time slot in which the user has to enter their input\n",
    "- the validation with the use of a regex construct\n",
    "- [and many more](https://pyinputplus.readthedocs.io/en/latest)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple input validation written with the use of the module could look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pyinputplus as pyip\n",
    "\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    number = pyip.inputFloat(prompt=\"How many centimeters are one inch? \", )\n",
    "    if number == 2.54:  \n",
    "        print('Correct!')\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    else: \n",
    "        print('Try again!')\n",
    "```\n",
    "An example execution of this code could look like:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "How many centimeters are one inch? twopointfivefour\n",
    "'twopointfivefour' is not a float.\n",
    "How many centimeters are one inch? 1   \n",
    "Try again!\n",
    "How many centimeters are one inch? 2.4\n",
    "Try again!\n",
    "How many centimeters are one inch? 2.54\n",
    "Correct!\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the code above you maybe not directly see the big advantages of the pyinputplus module but you should see how the module is structured. First, you should notice that it has to be imported because it is not a built-in module. Second, you should observe how the module functions can be used. In the case above the input is checked whether it is a floating number or not. For this, the method `inputFloat()` is used. The other modules are structured analogously to this module. Here is a list of the most important functions provided by the pyinputplus module (also see the [PyInputPlus documentation](https://pyinputplus.readthedocs.io/en/latest)):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `inputStr()` - Prompts the user to enter any string input. This is similar to Python’s input() and raw_input() functions, but with PyInputPlus’s additional features such as timeouts, retry limits, stripping, allowlist/blocklist, etc.\n",
    "- `inputNum()` - Prompts the user to enter a number, either an integer or a floating-point value. Returns an int or float value (depending on if the user entered a decimal in their input.)\n",
    "- `inputInt()` - Prompts the user to enter an integer value. Returns the integer as an int value. Also has min/max/greaterThan/lessThan parameters.\n",
    "- `inputFloat()` - Prompts the user to enter a floating point number value. Returns the number as a float. Also has min/max/greaterThan/lessThan parameters. \n",
    "- `inputBool()` - Prompts the user to enter a True/False response. The user can also enter t/f and in any case. Returns a boolean value.\n",
    "- `inputChoice()` - Prompts the user to enter one of the provided choices. Returns the selected choice as a string.\n",
    "- `inputMenu()` - Prompts the user to enter one of the provided choices. Also displays a small menu with bulleted, numbered, or lettered options. Returns the selected choice as a string.\n",
    "- `inputDate()` - Prompts the user to enter a date, formatted as a strptime-format in the formats list. Returns a datetime.date object.\n",
    "- `inputDatetime()` - Prompts the user to enter a datetime, formatted as a strptime-format in the formats list. Returns a datetime.datetime object.\n",
    "- `inputTime()` - Prompts the user to enter a date, formatted as a strptime-format in the formats list. Returns a datetime.time object.\n",
    "- `inputYesNo()` - Prompts the user to enter a yes/no response. The user can also enter y/n and use any case. Returns the yesVal or noVal argument (which default to 'yes' and 'no'), depending on the user’s selection.\n",
    "- `inputIp()` - Prompt the user to enter an IPv4 or IPv6 address. Returns the entered IP address as a string.\n",
    "- `inputRegex()` - Prompt the user to enter a string that matches the provided regex string (or regex object) and flags. Returns the entered string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these functions has different parameters that can be used. The following are the most common input parameters:\n",
    "- `prompt (str)`: The text to display before each prompt for user input. Identical to the prompt argument for Python’s raw_input() and input() functions. Default\n",
    "- `default (str, None)`: A default value to use should the user time out or exceed the number of tries to enter valid input.\n",
    "- `blank (bool)`: If True, blank strings will be allowed as valid user input.\n",
    "- `timeout (int, float)`: The number of seconds since the first prompt for input after which a TimeoutException is raised the next time the user enters input.\n",
    "- `limit (int)`: The number of tries the user has to enter valid input before the default value is returned.\n",
    "- `strip (bool, str, None)`: If True, whitespace is stripped from value. If a str, the characters in it are stripped from value. If None, nothing is stripped. Defaults to True.\n",
    "- `whitelistRegexes (Sequence, None)`: A sequence of regex str that will explicitly pass validation, even if they aren’t numbers. Defaults to None.\n",
    "- `blacklistRegexes (Sequence, None)`: A sequence of regex str or (regex_str, response_str) tuples that, if matched, will explicitly fail validation. Defaults to None.\n",
    "- `applyFunc (Callable, None)`: An optional function that is passed the user’s input, and returns the new value to use as the input.\n",
    "- `validationFunc (Callable)`: A function that is passed the user’s input value, which raises an exception if the input isn’t valid. (The return value of this function is ignored.)\n",
    "- `postValidateApplyFunc (Callable)`: An optional function that is passed the user’s input after it has passed validation, and returns a transformed version for the input function to return.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions which take a number as an input (`inputNum()`,`inputInt()`,`inputFloat()`) can use some mathematical parameters like `min`, `max`, `greaterThan` (>) and `lessThan` (<). Other input functions may have other additional parameters. To check this please take a look at the [official documentation](https://pyinputplus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#pyinputplus.inputNum)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you should be able to read and understand the following example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pyinputplus as pyip\n",
    "\n",
    "name = pyip.inputStr(prompt=\"What's your name? \")\n",
    "print(f\"\\nHi {name}! What's your favorite drink?\")\n",
    "favorite_drink = pyip.inputMenu(['coffee', 'black tea', 'energy drink', 'coke'], lettered=True, limit=0,\n",
    " default='coffee')\n",
    "daily_amount = pyip.inputInt(min=1,prompt=f\"\\nHow many {favorite_drink} do you drink a day?\")\n",
    "if daily_amount > 5:\n",
    "    print(f\"Hey {name}! Do you really drink {daily_amount} {favorite_drink} a day? That's insane!\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(f\"Hey {name}! Do you really drink only {daily_amount} {favorite_drink} a day? Are you sure you are working in IT?\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So an execution where all the input is correct would look like: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "What's your name? Sarah\n",
    "\n",
    "Hi Sarah! What's your favorite drink?\n",
    "Please select one of the following:\n",
    "A. coffee\n",
    "B. black tea\n",
    "C. energy drink\n",
    "D. coke\n",
    "B\n",
    "\n",
    "How many black tea do you drink a day? 3\n",
    "Hey Sarah! Do you really drink only 3 black tea a day? Are you sure you are working in IT?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens if the favorite drink is omitted? Verify your thoughts with the output above?\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "What's your name? Antoine\n",
    "\n",
    "Hi Antoine! What's your favorite drink?\n",
    "Please select one of the following:\n",
    "A. coffee\n",
    "B. black tea\n",
    "C. energy drink\n",
    "D. coke\n",
    "\n",
    "Blank values are not allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "How many coffee do you drink a day? 17\n",
    "Hey Antoine! Do you really drink 17 coffee a day? Thats insane!\n",
    "```\n",
    "Like you may have thought: Because the `limit` is set to 0 and the `default` value is set to coffee the favorite drink is set to coffee if no input is entered. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because a life without regex is not as fun as with, the pyinputplus module also can work with regex. You've already learned how powerful regex is. In this little example, you can observe how you can use a regex within your input validation code.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two different ways to use regex in the input validation module pyinputplus. The first one is to use the parameters `allowRegex` and/or `blockRegex`. As the name of the parameters already reveals, these parameters are to allow or to block different input. With an little example this should become clearer:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pyinputplus as pyip\n",
    "\n",
    "dns_server= pyip.inputIp(prompt=\"Enter your DNS Server: \", blockRegexes=[r'8.8.8.8','8.8.4.4'])\n",
    "print('Your DNS server is set to {0}'.format(dns_server))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If a user types in their DNS server the output could look like the following. Because of the given `blockRegexes` the user can't enter the Google DNS servers (8.8.8.8 / 8.8.4.4):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Enter your DNS Server: 8.8.8.8\n",
    "This response is invalid.\n",
    "Enter your DNS Server: 8.8.4.4\n",
    "This response is invalid.\n",
    "Enter your DNS Server: 1.1.1.1\n",
    "Your DNS server is set to 1.1.1.1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The second way to use the concept of regex is with the function `inputRegex()`. In this function, only input is permitted which matches the present regex string (or regex object). Also, a little example will bring clarity:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pyinputplus as pyip\n",
    "\n",
    "country = pyip.inputRegex(r'Sw[a-z]*land',prompt=\"Print your favorite country: \")\n",
    "print(f'You love {country}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If someone executes the code above a possible output could look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Print your favorite country: 12\n",
    "'12' does not match the specified pattern.\n",
    "Print your favorite country: America\n",
    "'America' does not match the specified pattern.\n",
    "Print your favorite country: Nigeria\n",
    "'Nigeria' does not match the specified pattern.\n",
    "Print your favorite country: Sweden\n",
    "'Sweden' does not match the specified pattern.\n",
    "Print your favorite country: Switzerland\n",
    "You love Switzerland\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Last but not least there is another handy feature that is implemented in the pyinputplus module. With the inputCustom() function it's possible to pass an self-written function to the input code. Therefore it's possible to write your validation logic. Furthermore, the following points can be defined by yourself:\n",
    "The valid arguments which the user has to enter so that the program works correctly\n",
    "The return value which should be returned by the self-coded function (depending on the result of the executed code)\n",
    "The exception or error which should be raised if the input wasn't formatted validly\n",
    "The short program below should help to familiarize you with the inputCustom() concept:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pyinputplus as pyip\n",
    "\n",
    "def allowed_to_drive(age):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        age = int(age)\n",
    "        if age >= 18:\n",
    "            return f\"You've been allowed to drive for {age - 18} years!\"\n",
    "        else: \n",
    "            return f\"You have to wait {18-age} years\"\n",
    "    except:\n",
    "        raise Exception(\"You have to enter your age (number digits)!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    result = pyip.inputCustom(allowed_to_drive,prompt=\"Enter the age to check if you are already allowed to drive: \")\n",
    "    print(result)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A sample execution could look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Enter the age to check if you are already allowed to drive: 12\n",
    "You have to wait 6 years\n",
    "Enter the age to check if you are already allowed to drive: 30\n",
    "You've been allowed to drive for 12 years!\n",
    "Enter the age to check if you are already allowed to drive: ten\n",
    "You have to enter your age (number digits)!\n",
    "Enter the age to check if you are already allowed to drive: \n",
    "Blank values are not allowed.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
