    "This notebook covers [chapter 7](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter7/) of the book.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Regex Pattern Object\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a new regex `Pattern` object is done by using the `compile` function of the `re` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import re\n",
    "phone_number_regex = re.compile(r'\\+\\d{9,15}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding a pattern is done by using the method `search` of the regex `Pattern` object. This returns either a `Match` object if the pattern has been found in the given string or else `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "phone_number_regex.search('My number is +41552221838')\n",
    "# <re.Match object; span=(13, 25), match='+41552221838'>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding all patterns is done by using the `findall` method of the regex `Pattern` object. `findall` returns a list of strings, not `Match` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "phone_number_regex.findall('My phone number is +41552221838, my fax number is +41552224270')\n",
    "# ['+41552221838', '+41552224270']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions can also be used directly using the module level functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "re.search(r'\\+\\d{9,15}', 'My number is +41552221838')\n",
    "re.findall(r'\\+\\d{9,15}', 'My phone number is +41552221838, my fax number is +41552224270')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Replacing\n",
    "\n",
    "Replacing patterns or parts of patterns is done using the `sub` method of the regex `Pattern` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "phone_number_regex.sub('CENSORED', 'My number is +41552221838')\n",
    "# 'My number is CENSORED'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`sub` can be called at the module level, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "re.sub(r'\\+\\d{9,15}', 'CENSORED', 'My number is +41552221838')\n",
    "# 'My number is CENSORED'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flags\n",
    "\n",
    "The regex functions and methods take an optional argument `flags` which allows to modify how they behave.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `IGNORECASE`: Perform case-insensitive matching\n",
    "- `DOTALL`: The `.` also matches newlines.\n",
    "- `VERBOSE`: Whitespaces in the pattern are ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full list of flags is available at the [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple flags can be passed using `|`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "re.compile('foo', re.IGNORECASE | re.DOTALL | re.VERBOSE)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "You can extract different parts (groups) of the pattern using brackets in the expression  and reference them using backslash plus group number:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "re.search(r'\\+41(\\d{2})(\\d{7})', 'My number is +41552221838').groups()\n",
    "# ('55', '2221838')\n",
    "re.sub(r'\\+41(\\d{2})(\\d{7})', r'0\\1*******', 'My number is +41552221838')\n",
    "# 'My number is 055*******'\n",
    "```\n",
