    "# Manipulating Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter you will learn how to manipulate strings, so you can work more flexibly. There are several possibilities to adjust strings, like removing parts of them, convert letters from uppercase into lowercase and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers some parts of [chapter 6](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter6/) of the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get more information you can visit [Python Tutorial: Strings](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#strings) and [W3C Schools: Python Strings](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp)."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are sequences of bytes, which represent characters, just like in other programming languages. You can access a single element of the string with square brackets. Fortunately Python has many helpful string methods to process text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Single and Double Quotes\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python you can produce string literals in two ways by surrounding the whole text with single quotation marks (`'text'`) or double quotation marks (`\"text\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "A problem arises if you use single quote marks to surround the text and use them in the text itself again. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print('That's a lot of fun.')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the row doesn't work because Python reads only until it reaches the second single quote mark as a string. So you will get just `That` as a string and an error because of the unreadable subsequent part `s a lot of fun.'`. The same happens if you want to use double quote marks themselves in your text.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"That's a lot of fun.\")\n",
    "print('That\\'s a lot of fun.')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a single quote in the text itself, you can solve the problem with two variants. First, you can use double quote marks as surrounding. Second, you can use an escape character before the desired single quote.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"He asked, \"What?\", and left.\")\n",
    "print(\"He asked, \\\"What?\\\", and left.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you want to integrate double quote marks in the text itself, you have to use an escape character before each mark.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Escape Characters\n",
    "\n",
    "With the help of an escape character, Python is able to write illegal characters into the string. Therefore you can use them to structure your text too.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Escape character | Print as             |\n",
    "| :--------------- | :------------------- |\n",
    "| \\\\'              | Single quote         |\n",
    "| \\\\\"              | Double quote         |\n",
    "| \\t               | Tab                  |\n",
    "| \\n               | Newline (line break) |\n",
    "| \\\\\\              | Backslash             |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Raw Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you want to print out a whole file path as a string. An easier and faster way to do this is to use raw strings. You only need to insert an `r` before the actual text.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(r'C:\\Users\\Bob\\Desktop')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiline Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be really time-consuming if you had to use `\\n` several times to write a longer text as a string. To simplify this, you can use multiline strings with triple quotes (using either single quotes or double quotes). And another advantage in the example below is that you won't need to use an escape character after the word `haven`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# easier & faster to write\n",
    "print('''Dear Bob, \n",
    "\n",
    "You still haven't answered my question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sincerely,\n",
    "Ross''')\n",
    "\n",
    "# other possiblity, but takes a while to write it\n",
    "print('Dear Bob,\\n\n",
    "\\n\n",
    "You still haven\\'t answered my question.\\n\n",
    "\\n\n",
    "Sincerely,\\n\n",
    "Ross')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indexing and Slicing Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like lists, you can work with strings by using indices and slices.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "text = 'Hello, world!'\n",
    "text[0]   # output = 'H'\n",
    "text[0:5] # output = 'Hello' \n",
    "text[-1]  # output = '!' \n",
    "text[:5]  # output = 'Hello' \n",
    "text[7:]  # output = 'world!' \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formatting Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings can contain placeholders using the `{}` brackets. These are replaced with the provided values when calling `format` or when using f-Strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "greeting = 'Hello'\n",
    "person = 'Peter'\n",
    "text = '{}, {}!'.format(greeting, person)\n",
    "text = f'{greeting}, {person}!'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These placeholders can optionally contain instructions on how to fill in the provide values:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "value = 1.2345\n",
    "print(f'{value:.3}')  # only print 3 digits: 1.23\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A good overview of all possibilities, including instructions, is provided on [pyformat.info](https://pyformat.info/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### String Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The full list of available string methods is [documented in the Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods)."
